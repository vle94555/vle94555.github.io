	<p>Some information on the band <b>LANY</b>, as well as my experience seeing them in concert!</p>
	<div style="text-align:center">	
	<p><b>LANY</b> is a band of three members, and they have concerts all over the world. Some examples are 
	Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. Their genre of music is <u>Indie pop, Synth-pop, and Dream pop.</u>  
	Their tickets are usually around <u>$30 for general admission.</u>
	My brother and I have been to one of their concerts, and it was incredible. It was a lot of fun.
	There weren't too many people there. It was a nice amount of people. My brother was at the front 
	of the venue, near the stage. I was in the back, but it was still a lot of fun. There was a lot 
	of jumping and singing. The band had cool and colorful background screens for the crowd to look at 
	as well. After the concert, my brother and I actually waited to see if we could meet the members.
	It turned out that they were too tired to come and meet everyone, so we ended up leaving. 
	<strong>Overall, it was a great experience though.</strong>
